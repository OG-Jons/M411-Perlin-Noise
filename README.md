# Perlin Noise Image Generator

## Data measurements
We made tests and measured on different resolutions, how long it would take to generate an image. <br>
We tested every resolution 3 times and averaged the results.
This graph shows the summary of this test. <br>
![Image of graph](https://github.com/OG-Jons/M411-Perlin-Noise-Game/blob/master/public/data.png?raw=true) <br>
As you can clearly see, the time it takes to render, increases linearly with the resolution. <br>
